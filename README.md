# Google's Homepage Recreated
I rewrote <strong> Google's homepage </strong> in a couple days. It is not perfect but It was a project I did just for fun!

There are some known issues with it that I can't be bothered to fix as well as some features I decided not to add:
• It is not made to look good on mobile screens (it looks surprisingly good though)
• Buttons / icons do not redirect or work.
• Hovering on buttons is wrong as it changes its position
• Distances between each element is not 100% the same as the original Google Homepage
• Probably many more...

You may play with it / try to fix the things mentioned above but do not republish it with "Aslanis" in it.
